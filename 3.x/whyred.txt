• Use only magisk 23.0 and upward if available, else you will get safetynet API error message.
• WFD might be difficult to connect with certain kernel.
• Make sure to turn off blur to reduce jitter in status bar while doing gaming/screen recording or to improve system animation fluidness.
• If you want to use magisk, don't forget to turn on magiskhide to make safetynet passed.
• For gapps, recommended to use Nik or Flame, just don't install the full variant for Nik.
• Use NikGapps build 3 July and later, as it is already fixed the backup script (so you won't need to reflash gapps everytime upgrade build)
• Also please, don't install gapps which has packageinstaller like opengapps to avoid problem when uninstalling apps, like uninstall failed or force closed.
• Don't install Nikgapps pixel launcher addons as it causing black screen, just install Flame Pixel Launcher or Pixel Launcher Magisk Module or MrSluffy ones instead if you want.
• LDAC codec is not working on QTI Bluetooth because hardware limitation, just enable "Disable Bluetooth A2DP hardware offload" in developer option if you're using headphone/iem/anything with LDAC codec
